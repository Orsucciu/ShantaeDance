# ShantaeDance
A little side project, to learn game and animation basics.

The goal is to animate sprites, play sound, handle user inputs, play music, and maybe handle collisions too.

Shantae is a character from "Shantae"by WayForward games, the sprites were downloaded from Spriter-resource, the music was ripped 
from the gba game by me.

For now, shantae is just dancing. The goal is to add music.
