# ShantaeDance
A little side project, to learn game and animation basics.

The goal is to animate sprites, play sound, handle user inputs, play music, and maybe handle collisions too.

Shantae is a character from "Shantae"by WayForward technologies, the sprites were downloaded from Spriter-resource, the music was ripped 
from the gba game by me.

The project is running here -> https://cdn.rawgit.com/Orsucciu/ShantaeDance/master/index.html

For now, shantae is just dancing. The goal is to add music.

The code is really messy, and has to be optimized so i can actually use it. working on that
